# Personal Project: To-Do-List

# Purpose of Project
This project is a mini full-stack as it includes the development of both the backend and frontend from end-to-end. 
As the name suggest, it is a to-do-list project so individuals can organize their day without the requirement of signing in.
I used React and Bootstrap for the frontend as a way to have a functional webpage as quickly as possible to some styling.
For the backend, I used Spring Boot to create RESTFUL APIs and MongoDB to store tasks as JSON documents. MongoDB was chosen to store
tasks as I plan to add more fields in the future as well as an interest in this particular DB. 
MongoDB is a NoSQL DB that is both easy to understand and use. All technologies I've used are those I want to practice and learn new skills.
